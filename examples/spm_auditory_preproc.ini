# pypreprocess configuration.
#
# Copy this file to the acquisition directory containing the data you wish to
# preprocess. Then, manually edit the values to customize the pipeline to suite your
# needs.
#
# Disable a preprocessing step by setting 'disable = True' under the corresponding
# section, or simply comment the section altogether.
#
# IMPORTANT NOTES
# ===============
# - indexing begins from 1 (matlab style)
# - you can explicitly specifiy the software to be used for a specific stage of the
#   preprocessing by accordingly setting the 'software' field under the
#   corresponding section (e.g like so: software = spm)
# - A value of 'auto', 'unspecified', 'none', etc. for a parameter means it should
# be specified or inferred at run-time
